# zsh-vi-mode-clipboard

Changes Zsh's vi-mode to use the system clipboard instead of an internal buffer.  
Supports `y`, `yy`, and `Y` for yanking and `p` and `P` for pasting.

## Installation

The recommended installation method is to use a Zsh plugin manager like [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) or you can source the shell file from your `.zshrc`.

Also requires xclip.
